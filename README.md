## Agile:

My project, Farah Travels, was created using an Agile priciple, which was managed througha project board on Github. This was a vital step towards ensuring that the design of my project was amazing. As this was my first time as an individual developer implementing agile the use of it had allowed me to have a structured framework which facilitated the development process and productivity of my app.

### Benefits of using Agile in my project was:

- The user stories provided specific goals to target, which helped in maintaining focus and reducing distractions.
- By focusing on user stories, the development process remained user-centric, ensuring that the application met the end-users' needs and provided a seamless user experience.
- Agile's flexibility allowed for adjustments and changes to be made as new insights and requirements emerged during the development process.


## Design Choices: 

### Colour Scheme

- Login/signup/forgot password: 
    - Background colour - #f0f0f0
    - Login container - rgba(173, 216, 230, 0.5); 
    - Button - #007bff

- Base pages:
    - Background colour - #f0f0f0
    - Home Page Cards - rgba(173, 216, 230, 0.5); 
    - Home Page Card Text - #333
    - Home Page Button - #007bff

I chose the colours of my travel app because it beautifully integrates the vibrant colours which enhances my user experience. This in fact makes the planning of a trip visually engaging and enjoyable. I have thought carefully about the implementations of my colours throughout so that the users can have a great journey whilst creating a their trip.

## Typography

I chose the following fonts so that my app would look professional and clean throughout, i did not want to go too over board and made sure my priortiy was user engagment and swiftness. Therefore i chose these fonts so that it would be easy to navigate through content on my app.

- 'Arial', sans-serif;

## DataBase Design:

![Screenshot of the project](static/images/lucidchart.jpg)

I used Lucid Chart to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), This was very helpful when i started planning out my Farah Travels app. The ERD made it easy to see how the databases connect and understand the relationships between tables. The arrows showed how the data fields are linked, ensuring a logical data structure and making the development process smoother.

## Data Models:

![Screenshot of the project](static/images/schema.png)

My database schema is designed to manage a travel application with user authentication and various features for managing trips, notifications, profiles. At the core of the schema is the User table, which utilizes Django's built-in User model for user management. This table includes fields for usernames, passwords, emails, and user status attributes such as whether the user is active, or a superuser. Django Allauth is integrated to handle user authentication, registration, and social login features, ensuring a secure and user-friendly authentication process.


- The User table stores essential user information, using Django's built-in model for authentication and user management. Each user can create, update, and delete trips, with these trips linked to the user via the Trip table. This table includes details like trip name, destination, dates, number of people, and departure airport.

- Notifications are handled through the Notification table, linked to the User table. Each notification is associated with a user and includes a message notifiying the user on the change or action preformed.

- The Profile table has a one-to-one relationship with the User table, storing additional personal information like full name, address, date of birth, phone number, passport number, and emergency contact details.
