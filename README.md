## Agile:

My project, Farah Travels, was created using an Agile priciple, which was managed througha project board on Github. This was a vital step towards ensuring that the design of my project was amazing. As this was my first time as an individual developer implementing agile the use of it had allowed me to have a structured framework which facilitated the development process and productivity of my app.

### Benefits of using Agile in my project was:

- The user stories provided specific goals to target, which helped in maintaining focus and reducing distractions.
- By focusing on user stories, the development process remained user-centric, ensuring that the application met the end-users' needs and provided a seamless user experience.
- Agile's flexibility allowed for adjustments and changes to be made as new insights and requirements emerged during the development process.
